# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Card

![Design preview for the FAQ Accordion Card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

To check the project go [here](https://faq-accordion-card-mbart13.vercel.app/).

This is another newbie challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io, where goal is to get the page looking as close to the design as possible.
This one was also challenging, because of background images that you need to position in certain way. I also learned how important is keyboard accesibility for pages like this.

In this project I used:
- SASS
- Flexbox
- pseudo-elements for styling
- a little bit of JavaScript for user interaction
